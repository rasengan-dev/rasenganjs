## What this is

AI writing has patterns. Predictable phrases, structures, rhythms. This skill teaches Claude (or any LLM) to catch and remove them.

## Quick start

**Claude Code:** Add this folder as a skill.

**Claude Projects:** Upload `SKILL.md` and reference files to project knowledge.

**Custom instructions:** Copy core rules from `SKILL.md`.

**API calls:** Include `SKILL.md` in your system prompt. Reference files load on demand.

## What it catches

**Banned phrases** - Throat-clearing openers, emphasis crutches, business jargon, all adverbs, vague declaratives, meta-commentary. See `references/phrases.md`.

**Structural clichés** - Binary contrasts, negative listings, dramatic fragmentation, rhetorical setups, false agency, narrator-from-a-distance voice, passive voice. See `references/structures.md`.

**Sentence-level rules** - No Wh- sentence starters, no em dashes, no staccato fragmentation, no lazy extremes, active voice required.

## Scoring

Rate 1-10 on each dimension:

| Dimension    | Question                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Directness   | Statements or announcements?  |
| Rhythm       | Varied or metronomic?         |
| Trust        | Respects reader intelligence? |
| Authenticity | Sounds human?                 |
| Density      | Anything cuttable?            |
