## Upgrade from 1.1.x to 1.2.x

If you want to improve the performance of your application — especially as it grows in size — upgrading to **version `1.2.x`** is a great choice.

This version introduces two major features:

### Lazy Loaded Routes

Routes are now loaded **on demand**, based on the page the user is visiting.
This means your app only loads what it needs, when it needs it — which helps reduce initial load time and makes navigation feel faster.

<br />

Everything is handled automatically, there is no option to opt out this feature.

### SSG (Static Site Generation)

You can now generate **static HTML files** for your pages ahead of time.
This improves performance, SEO, and allows your site to be served extremely fast, without waiting for server responses or client-side rendering.

<br />

The configuration is simple, inside the `rasengan.config.js` file, you just have to enable the `prerender` option.

```js title="rasengan.config.js" {5}
import { defineConfig } from 'rasengan';
import { rasengan } from 'rasengan/plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  prerender: true,
  vite: {
    plugins: [rasengan()],
  },
});
```

This is the minimal configuration, it will enable the prerender globally into your application. If you prefer, you can select what you really want to prerender.

```js title="rasengan.config.js" {5-7}
import { defineConfig } from 'rasengan';
import { rasengan } from 'rasengan/plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  prerender: {
    routes: ['/', 'blog/**'],
  },
  vite: {
    plugins: [rasengan()],
  },
});
```

This approach is ideal for **hybrid applications**, where:

* Public pages are statically generated
* Authenticated or dynamic routes remain rendered via SSR or SPA


<br />
So, to upgrade you have to follow the following steps:
