# File-Based Routing in Rasengan.js

Rasengan.js introduces a powerful and intuitive **file-based routing system**, inspired by modern frameworks but tailored to its own conventions.

All route definitions live inside the special folder: `app/_routes/`

The file and folder structure under this directory determines your app’s routing automatically.


## Directory Structure Example

``` bash
app/
├── _routes/
│   ├── index.page.tsx             # → /
│   ├── home.page.tsx              # → /home
│   ├── about/
│   │   ├── layout.tsx             # Layout for /about/*
│   │   └── index.page.tsx         # → /about
│   ├── blog/
│   │   ├── index.page.tsx         # → /blog
│   │   ├── [id].page.tsx          # → /blog/:id
│   │   └── [slug]/
│   │       └── index.page.tsx     # → /blog/:slug
│   ├── _settings/
│   │   └── index.page.tsx         # → /, /settings
│   └── [_locale]/
│       └── home.page.tsx          # → /home, /en/home, /fr/home, etc.
└── app.router.ts                  # Entry point to register the routes
```
> Note: The `app.router.ts` file is the entry point to register the routes.

## Router 

The file-based routing system in Rasengan.js automatically generates a `Router` component based on your folder and file structure.

To integrate this generated router into your app, create a file at: 

```txt 
src/app/app.router.ts
```
<AlertWithDescription 
  title="Warning"
  description="`app.router.ts` is a required file, you have to place it at the src/app/ folder."
  status="warning"
/>

And add the following:

```tsx title="src/app/app.router.ts" showLineNumbers {2,7}
import { RouterComponent, defineRouter } from 'rasengan';
import Router from 'virtual:rasengan/router';

class AppRouter extends RouterComponent {}

export default defineRouter({
  imports: [Router],
})(AppRouter);
```

### How It Works

- Rasengan.js exposes a virtual module named `virtual:rasengan/router`.
- This module automatically includes all pages, layouts, and routes defined in `/app/_routes`.
- You simply import it and inject it into your `AppRouter` using the `defineRouter` helper.

This setup ensures that your routing configuration stays fully synchronized with your file structure — **no manual registration required**.

## Pages

Every file ending with `.page.tsx` defines a route. 

### Naming Convention

| File Name                 | Route Path        | Description                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `index.page.tsx`          | `/`               | Index route                         |
| `home.page.tsx`           | `/home`           | Normal route                        |
| `about/index.page.tsx`    | `/about`          | Index route in `about` folder       |
| `blog/index.page.tsx`     | `/blog`           | Index route in `blog` folder        |
| `blog/[id].page.tsx`      | `/blog/:id`       | Dynamic route on file page          |
| `blog/[_slug].page.tsx`   | `/blog/:slug?`    | Optional dynamic route on file page |
| `[_locale]/home.page.tsx` | `/:locale?/home`  | Optional dynamic route on folder    |

> 🖱 Only files located in `app/_routes/` are considered valid route definitions.

Page components have to be exported as default in order to be registered as routes.

```tsx title="src/app/_routes/home.page.tsx" showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
import { PageComponent } from "rasengan";

const Home: PageComponent = () => {
  return <div>Home Page</div>;
};

Home.metadata = {
  title: "Home",
  description: "Home Page"
};

export default Home;
```

<AlertWithDescription 
  title="Page Component"
  description="Don't define `path` manually onto the page definition, because it's directly extracted from the file and folder structure."
  status="info"
/>


## Layouts

Use `layout.tsx` files to define reusable structures (headers, sidebars, wrappers, etc.). A layout wraps all the routes inside its folder unless overridden by a deeper layout.

### File Structure

pages located at the same level of the layout or deeper will be wrapped by the layout.

```bash
app/
├── _routes/
│   ├── layout.tsx                 # Root Layout for all pages
│   ├── index.page.tsx             # → /
│   ├── about/
│   │   ├── layout.tsx             # Layout for /about/*
│   │   └── index.page.tsx         # → /about
│   └── [_locale]/
│       ├── layout.tsx             # Layout for /:locale?/*
│       └── home.page.tsx          # → /home, /en/home, /fr/home, etc.
└── app.router.ts                  # Entry point to register the routes
```

From this file structure, the `app/_routes/about/index.page.tsx` will be wrapped by the `app/_routes/about/layout.tsx` and the `app/_routes/layout.tsx`.

### Layout Component

The Layout Component has the be exported by default in order to be registered as a layout.

```tsx title="src/app/_routes/layout.tsx" showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
import { LayoutComponent, Outlet } from "rasengan";

const AppLayout: LayoutComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>My Header</header>
      <Outlet /> {/* Renders the current page */}
      <footer>My Footer</footer>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AppLayout;
```

| Layout Path                    | Applies To            |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| `app/_routes/layout.tsx`       | All routes            |
| `app/_routes/about/layout.tsx` | Routes under `/about` |

<AlertWithDescription
  title="Path Definition"
  description="When using `file based routing`, you don't need to define `path` manually onto the page and layout definition, because it's directly extracted from the file and folder structure."
  status="info"
></AlertWithDescription>


## Dynamic Routes

To create dynamic routes, wrap folder names in square brackets:

``` txt
app/_routes/blog/[slug]/index.page.tsx → /blog/:slug
or
app/_routes/blog/[slug].page.tsx → /blog/:slug
```

You can access dynamic params using:

```tsx
const { slug } = useParams(); // Rasengan.js core hook
```


## Optional Segments

Rasengan.js supports optional **static** and **dynamic** segments using the underscore (`_`) prefix.

### Optional Static Segments

To create a route that optionally includes a folder, prefix it with an underscore:

``` txt
app/_routes/_settings/index.page.tsx
```

Routes matched:

* `/`
* `/settings`


### Optional Dynamic Segments

Wrap the param in brackets and prefix with `_` to make it optional:

``` txt
app/_routes/[_locale]/home.page.tsx
```

Routes matched:

* `/home`
* `/en/home`
* `/fr/home`

Inside the component:

```tsx
const { locale } = useParams(); // Might be undefined
```


## Nested Routes

You can create deeply nested routes by nesting folders:

``` txt
app/_routes/dashboard/settings/index.page.tsx → /dashboard/settings
```

If you include a `layout.tsx` in `dashboard/`, it will wrap both `/dashboard` and `/dashboard/settings`.


## Grouping Routes

### What is a Route Group?

A **route group** is a **folder used for organizational purposes only**. It helps structure your codebase without affecting the actual URL path.

* It’s enclosed in parentheses: `(groupName)`
* It does **not** appear in the URL.
* Inspired by **Next.js App Router** and other modern frameworks.


### Example in Rasengan.js

```md /(blog)/
/app/_routes/(blog)/home.page.tsx → /home
```

Even if the page is inside the `(blog)` folder, the URL does **not** include `/blog`.

### Use Cases

* Organizing routes by domain (`(marketing)`, `(dashboard)`, `(auth)`)
* Sharing layout or logic across grouped routes
* Improving readability in large apps

> "**Route Groups** using parentheses ( ) to organize routes without affecting the final path."


## Routing Rules Summary

| Type               | Convention                 | Example Path                             | Matches                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Routes folder      | `app/_routes/`             | `app/_routes/home.page.tsx`              | `/home`                 |
| Page file          | `*.page.tsx`               | `index.page.tsx`, `profile.page.tsx`     | `/`, `/profile`         |
| Dynamic segment    | `[param]/index.page.tsx`   | `app/_routes/blog/[slug]/index.page.tsx` | `/blog/:slug`           |
| Optional segment   | `_folder/`, `[_param]/`    | `_settings`, `[_locale]`                 | `/`, `/settings`, `/en` |
| Layout wrapper     | `layout.tsx` in any folder | `app/_routes/about/layout.tsx`           | Applies to `/about/*`   |


## Coming Soon

Rasengan.js plans to support:

* **Catch-all routes** with `[...param]`
* **Param validation & static type inference**


## Best Practices

* Always place route files under `app/_routes/`
* Prefer `index.page.tsx` for folder roots
* Use layouts to reduce duplication and enhance structure
* Use optional segments thoughtfully to avoid ambiguous paths
