# Rasengan CLI

The Rasengan CLI is a command-line interface integrated natively in Rasengan.js. It provides a set of commands to help you with your development workflow.

<br />

To use the CLI, you have to pass through the `scripts` property in your `package.json` file.

## Commands

### rasengan dev 

The `rasengan dev` command starts the development server.

First, you need to set the `dev` script in your `package.json` file.

```json title="package.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "rasengan dev"
  } 
}
```

Then, you can run the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm run dev
```
This will start the application in dev mode. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5320`.

<br />
The default port can be changed with `-p` option, like follow:

```json title="package.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "rasengan dev -p 3000"
  } 
}
```

or just 

```bash title="Terminal"
npm run dev -- -p 3000
```


### rasengan build

The `rasengan build` command builds the application for production.

First, you need to set the `build` script in your `package.json` file.

```json title="package.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rasengan build"
  }
}
```

Then, you can run the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm run build
```
