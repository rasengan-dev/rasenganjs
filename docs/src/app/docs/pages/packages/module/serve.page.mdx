# Rasengan Serve

`@rasenganjs/serve` is a simple utility to launch your Rasengan.js application in production mode. It serves the built application from the `dist` directory, ensuring a smooth and optimized deployment.

## Installation

To use `@rasenganjs/serve`, install it as a dependency in your project:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @rasenganjs/serve
```

## Usage

After building your application with Rasengan.js, you can start the production server using the `rasengan-serve` command.

### Start the production server

<StepItem
  step="01"
  title="Define the serve command"
  content={`
    Add the following command to your \`package.json\` file to start the production server:
  `}
>
```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "serve": "rasengan-serve ./dist"
  }
}
```
</StepItem>

<StepItem
  step="02"
  title="Run the serve command"
  content={`
    Run the following command in your terminal:
  `}
>
```bash title="Terminal"
npm run serve
```
</StepItem>

This will start a server that serves your application from the `dist` folder.

### Options

Currently, `@rasenganjs/serve` provides a default configuration for serving your built project. Future updates may include additional options for customization.

#### Custom port

You can specify a custom port for the server by using the `--p` or `--port` option:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm run serve -- -p 3000
```

or 

```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm run serve -p 3000
```

The `-p` option stands for `port`, and allow you to specify a custom port for the server by replacing the default port `4320` for production server.
