# Create Rasengan CLI


The easiest way to get started with Rasengan.js is by using `create-rasengan`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Rasengan.js application, with everything set up for you.

## Usage

You can create a new project just by running one of the following command:

<Tabs 
  tabs={[
    {
      title: "npx",
    },
    {
      title: "npm",
    },
    {
      title: "pnpm",
    },
    {
      title: "yarn",
    },
  ]}
  activeIndex={0}
  className="mb-4"
>
<Tabs.Item>
```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-rasengan@latest
```
</Tabs.Item>
<Tabs.Item>
```bash title="Terminal" 
npm create rasengan
```
</Tabs.Item>
<Tabs.Item>
```bash title="Terminal" copy
pnpm create rasengan
```
</Tabs.Item>
<Tabs.Item>
```bash title="Terminal" copy
yarn create rasengan
```
</Tabs.Item>
</Tabs>


You will then be asked the following prompts:

```bash title="Terminal"
- What would you like to name your project?
- Which language would you like to use for your project?
- Which template would you like to use?
```

Once you've answered the prompts, a new project will be created with the correct configuration depending on your answers.

### Options

You can also pass the following options to the `create-rasengan` command:

#### project name 

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-rasengan@latest my-app
```

#### skip questions (-y or --yes)

`-y` option stands for `yes`, which means the CLI has to take all the default answers.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-rasengan@latest my-app -y
```

#### beta (--beta or --experimental)

`--beta` is used to initialize a new Rasengan.js project with the lastest beta version available. Note that, if the `stable` version is already available this option will not take effect.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-rasengan@latest my-app --beta
```

#### git (--git)

`--git` create the first commit after the project has been generated.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-rasengan@latest my-app --git
```

#### language (--language)

`--language` is used to selected a language directly from `(javascript or typescript)`.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-rasengan@latest my-app --language typescript
```

#### with-shadcn (--with-shadcn)

`--with-shadcn` is used to initialize a new Rasengan.js project with Shadcn UI configured and ready to use.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-rasengan@latest my-app --with-shadcn
```

The default language used is `typescript`, but you can also use `javascript` by passing the `--language javascript` option.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-rasengan@latest my-app --with-shadcn --language javascript
```

## Why use create-rasengan ?

`create-rasengan` allows you to create a new Rasengan.js app within seconds. It is officially maintained by the creators of Rasengan.js, and includes a number of benefits:

- **Interactive Experience**: Running `npx create-rasengan@latest` launches an interactive experience that guides you through setting up a project.
- **Direct use**: You don't need to install the CLI globally before using it.
