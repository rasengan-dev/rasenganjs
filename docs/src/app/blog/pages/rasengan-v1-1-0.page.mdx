`Rasengan v1.1.0` is now available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rasengan).

<br />

In this post, we will talk about the new features of Rasengan v1.1.0 and how you can adopt them into your projects.

For a list of breaking changes, see the Change log.

## What's new in Rasengan v1.1.0?

### Introduction of File-based routing

Rasengan v1.1.0 introduces you the <Link to="/docs/routing/file-based-routing">**file-based routing**</Link> feature. This feature allows you to create routes based on the file structure of your project.
<br />

To use this feature, you have to create files in the `src/app/_routes` directory and always export a component from it by default in order to be considered.

```tsx title="src/app/_routes/index.page.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { PageComponent } from "rasengan";

const Page: PageComponent = () => {
  return <h1>Home</h1>;
}

Page.metadata = {
  title: "Home",
  description: "Home page",
}

export default Page;
```
<br />

This will create a route for the `index` page with the path `/`.
<br />

You can also create nested routes by creating a directory in the `src/app/_routes` directory and exporting a component from it.
```tsx title="src/app/_routes/blog/index.page.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { PageComponent } from "rasengan";

const Page: PageComponent = () => {
  return <h1>Blog</h1>;
}

Page.metadata = {
  title: "Blog",
  description: "Blog page",
}

export default Page;
```
<br />

This will create a route for the `blog` page with the path `/blog`.

<br />

In order to work perfectly, you need to cover a last step, by importing the Router component that represent your file-based routes into the `app.router.ts` file.

```tsx title="src/app/app.router.ts" showLineNumbers {2,7}
import { RouterComponent, defineRouter } from "rasengan";
import Router from "virtual:rasengan/router";

class AppRouter extends RouterComponent {}

export default defineRouter({
  imports: [Router],
})(AppRouter);
```

Now you are ready to use the file-based routing feature ðŸ˜Š.

### Introduction of NavLink component

Rasengan v1.1.0 introduces you the <Link to="/docs/api-reference/components/navlink">**NavLink**</Link> component. This component is a wrapper around the `<Link>` component with additional props for styling `active` and `pending` states.


### Introduction of @rasenganjs/i18n package

We are proud to announce you the release of the <Link to="/packages/i18n">@rasenganjs/i18n</Link> package.

The purpose is to provide internationalization support to your application based on static files (JSON format) holding the translations.

<br />

The package is currently in `beta` and we are working on it to make it more stable and to add more features. If you want to try it out, you can install it via npm.

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @rasenganjs/i18n@1.0.0-beta.3
```

For futher information, see the <Link to="/packages/i18n">@rasenganjs/i18n</Link> package documentation.

### Add support for shadcn into create-rasengan CLI

Building website is good, but doing it even faster is better.

<Link to="https://ui.shadcn.com" target="_blank">Shadcn</Link> is a set of beautifully designed components that you can customize, extend, and build on.

<br />

In the previous version of <Link to="/packages/create-rasengan">create-rasengan CLI</Link> package, we were supporting only Tailwind CSS (both v3 and v4) and we were not supporting any UI framework.

<br />

Now, we are supporting Shadcn UI, that means you have the possibility to initialize your project with Shadcn UI well configured with just one command.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-rasengan@latest --with-shadcn
```

This command will generate a new project with Shadcn UI configured and ready to use.
