<br />

In this post, we will talk about the new features of Rasengan v1.1.3 and how you can adopt them into your projects.

For a list of breaking changes, see the Change log.

## What's new in Rasengan v1.1.3?

### Introduction of `ScrollRestoration` component

Rasengan v1.1.3 introduces you the <Link to="/docs/routing/file-based-routing">**ScrollRestoration**</Link> component. It is a special component that is used to restore the scroll position of the current page.
<br />

To use this feature, you have to put the `<ScrollRestoration />` component where you want to restore the scroll position, generally in your root layout.

```tsx title="src/app/app.layout.tsx" showLineNumbers copy /ScrollRestoration/ {6}
import { LayoutComponent, Outlet, ScrollRestoration } from "rasengan";

const AppLayout: LayoutComponent = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <ScrollRestoration />
      <Outlet />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Logs update into `@rasenganjs/serve` package

When hosting your application on production or just trying to preview your application in a production environment, you have to use the `@rasenganjs/serve` adapter package.

This package is a simple and fast way to deploy your application on a private server (VPS).

<br />

This new release also updates the `@rasenganjs/serve` package to the latest version, by adding some new features and fixing some bugs.

- Added `--port` option to specify the port on which the server will run
- Enhanced the `logs` to be more readable and identifiable by adding timestamps for each log
